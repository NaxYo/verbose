# Custom Icons for Verbose

Place your custom icon files in this directory with these exact filenames:

- **idle.png** - Shown when listening for hotkey (gray/idle state)
- **recording.png** - Shown when actively recording audio (red/active state)
- **processing.png** - Shown when processing transcription (orange/busy state)

## Requirements

- Format: PNG or SVG
- Recommended size: 22x22 or 24x24 pixels (system tray size)
- Transparent background works best
- Simple, clear designs that are visible at small sizes

## Tips

- Use different colors to distinguish states (e.g., gray, red, orange)
- Keep designs simple - they'll be displayed very small in the system tray
- Test visibility against both light and dark backgrounds
- Monochrome icons with transparency often work best for system trays
